Welcome to the Walmart Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This repository contains a comprehensive EDA of the Walmart dataset, aimed at uncovering valuable insights and patterns within the data to support data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

## üìÑ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `index`: Index of the dataset
- `SHIPPING_LOCATION`: Location from where the products are shipped
- `DEPARTMENT`: Department of the product
- `CATEGORY`: Category of the product
- `SUBCATEGORY`: Subcategory of the product
- `BREADCRUMBS`: Breadcrumbs for navigation
- `SKU`: Stock Keeping Unit identifier
- `PRODUCT_NAME`: Name of the product
- `BRAND`: Brand of the product
- `PRICE_RETAIL`: Retail price of the product
- `PRICE_CURRENT`: Current price of the product
- `PRODUCT_SIZE`: Size of the product
- `RunDate`: Date of the data run
- `tid`: Transaction ID

## üîç Key Insights

In this project, we performed various analyses to extract meaningful insights from the data. Here are some key insights derived from the analysis:

1. **Price Analysis**: Comparison of retail and current prices to understand discount strategies.
2. **Category Distribution**: Distribution of products across different categories and subcategories.
3. **Brand Popularity**: Identification of the most popular brands based on the number of products.
4. **Shipping Locations**: Analysis of the most common shipping locations.
5. **Department Analysis**: Examination of the product distribution across various departments.
6. **Product Sizes**: Insights into the range of product sizes available.
7. **Sales Performance**: Evaluation of sales performance based on price data.
8. **Inventory Management**: Insights into stock keeping units (SKU) and their distribution.
9. **Consumer Preferences**: Understanding consumer preferences based on category and brand data.
10. **Discount Strategies**: Analysis of price differences to infer discount strategies.

## üìä Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations to support the insights and analyses:

1. **Bar Plots**: For comparing category and department distributions.
2. **Box Plots**: To visualize price distributions and detect outliers.
3. **Histograms**: For analyzing the frequency distribution of numerical features.
4. **Heatmaps**: To identify correlations between different numerical features.
5. **Pie Charts**: To represent the proportion of different categories and brands.
6. **Scatter Plots**: For analyzing relationships between numerical variables.
7. **Line Charts**: To visualize trends over time.
8. **Count Plots**: To count the occurrences of categorical features.

## üìå Conclusion

This EDA project provides a thorough exploration of the Walmart dataset, revealing key insights that can drive informed decision-making. The visualizations and analyses offer a clear understanding of Walmart's product distribution, pricing strategies, and consumer preferences. By leveraging these findings, Walmart can optimize its operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and achieve greater business success.
